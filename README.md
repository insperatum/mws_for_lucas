# Wake Sleep Variational Autoencoder
Kinda EC-meets-neural-statistician

## Todo:
- [ ] Neural network qi, trained off-policy using frontier
- [X] Robustfill character filter
- [ ] Adaptor regex for each task
- [ ] Tasks can reference other tasks (avoid cycles) 
- [X] Empirical primitives
- [x] More instances per class, with VHE style encoder
- [x] Differentiate through regex to modify \*, train custom character classes, etc.

Maybe todo:  
- [ ] Robustfill pretrained on regex, and/or modify architecture to include 'copy from input'
- [ ] Is there a memory leak?
- [ ] Reinforce baseline for neural qi? idk...
